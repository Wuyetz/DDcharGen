Dungeons and Dragons random charachter generator in C#

Creates random Dungeons and Dragons character (race,class,gender,alignment). I adapted it from Dungeons and Dragons party generator I 
made in javascript, html, css and jquery. Check it out in Visual Studio, or download it as zip and navigate to: /fantasy/bin/debug and run the Fantasy application from there. Original Dungeons and Dragons party generator can be found at : 
https://github.com/Wuyetz/DDparty and seen in action at : https://wuyetz.github.io/DDparty/ .
